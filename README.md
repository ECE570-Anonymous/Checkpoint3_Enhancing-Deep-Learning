# Checkpoint3_Enhancing-Deep-Learning

This submission includes three non-trivial implementations, each exploring a different deep learning technique under constrained compute environments (CPU-only, small batch sizes, and limited training epochs).

## Environment Setup

- Python 3.10
- CPU-only execution
- local laptop (Intel i5, 8GB RAM)
